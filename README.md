## Project Description:

The project aims to create a database system for selling tours. The main technologies used will be MySQL for database management and PHP for implementing business logic. To improve the appearance and interactivity of the system, the Bootstrap library will also be used to create a responsive user interface.

## System functionalities:

- Trip management: adding, deleting, and editing tours in the database.
- Trip reservations: users will be able to make reservations for selected tours.
- User management: registration, login, and management of user data.
- Administrative panel: accessible only to privileged users, allowing for the management of trips, reservations, and users.
- Displaying information about trips, such as description,trip date, trip operator, price, available slots, etc.
- Integration with payment system: option to make payments for trip reservations. There is also an option to cancel a purchased trip.
- Reporting system: showing which operators, trips, trip dates, etc. are most attractive to customers.
- Filtering of displayed trips.
